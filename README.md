# Telomere-to-Telomere diploid Indian Genome 
We have sequenced a EBV-immortalized human male cell line from SG10k samples on different platforms. The data contains ~106x of Pacbio HiFi, ~64x of Oxford Nanopore (ONT) Duplex, ~222x ONT Ultralong (ULONT), ~100x MGI WGS short reads, ~33x Illumina WGS short reads and ~120x Omni-C for the child sample (I002C). Statistics of BioNano will be added soon.

For parental samples:
SampleType | SampleID | HiFi (REVIO) | Duplex | MGI
---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
Father|I002A|60x|21x|35x
Mother|I002B|61x|20x|37x

# Assembly release
### v0.2
This version of the assembly contains Telomere-to-Telomere chromsomes for both maternal and paternal haplotypes including a mitochondria. In this version of the genomes, rDNAs have not been resolved. We have provided the potential rDNA cluster region in the acro-centric chromosomes as a bed files.
